## Course Grade

Final grades are broken down as follows:

| **Item**           | **Points**    |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| Homework           | 15%           |
| Presentation       | 10%           |
| Exams              | 20% x 2 = 40% |
| Final Exam         | 35%           |
| **Total**          | 100%          |

## Homework

Homeworks will submitted via Github classroom in the form of a Jupyter notebook within a GitHub repository. Written work will be typed out in Markdown (see Markdown introduction [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) with equations formatted using Latex (see Latex introduction [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions)). Numerical solutions will be completed using Python.

## Class Presentations

Students will give one presentation on the solution to a transient heat/mass transfer problem found in the provided [Conduction Heat Transfer Solutions](https://github.com/uw-cheme512/gradmath2019/blob/master/student_presentations/heat_transfer_solutions.pdf). Students can sign up for a presentation date [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kF6XKiX3tJOpuOQfxG4tSMkHaaxj6yw-UsPFIz7lbQo/edit?usp=sharing). The presentations must include:

1. A diagram of the specified problem.
2. A mathematical expression of the unsolved differential equation, with an explanation of each term.
3. An explanation of the expected behavior of the solution using the boundary conditions and initial conditions and stability theory
3. A step-by-step solution of the differential equation using analytical methods
4. A plot of the solution and an explanation of its behavior

Students can receive up to 5% extra credit by providing a numerical solution in addition to an analytical solution.

## Late Work

With the exception of pre-arrangement with the instructor in extenuating circumstances, **exams must be taken on the day scheduled**. No re-dos will be offered.

## Exams

All exams are cumulative. Students will be allowed a copy of the [cheatsheet](https://github.com/uw-cheme512/uw-cheme512.github.io/raw/master/notebooks/cheatsheet.pdf) printed on one page, with any additional notes they can fit on that page. **No textbooks will be allowed**. Calculators will not be necessary.
