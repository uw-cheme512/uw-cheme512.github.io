## Course Description

Applications of mathematics to problems in chemical engineering; vector calculus; properties and methods of solution of first and second order partial differential equations; similarity transforms, separation of variables, Laplace and Fourier transforms.

## Instructors

- Prof. Chad Curtis (ccurtis7@uw.edu)

## Teaching Assistants

- Caitlin Parke (parkec3@uw.edu)

## Teaching Logistics

- Lectures: M/W/Th/F 11:30-12:20 (BNS 203)

## Course Objectives

1. Express physical phenomena (e.g. heat, mass, momentum transfer) as mathematical models.
2. Classify ordinary and partial differential equations (e.g. homogeneity, order, and linearity).
3. Visualize behavior of ordinary and partial differential equations without performing a complete solution.
4. Implement analytical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations using both exact and approximate methods.
5. Implement numerical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations using the finite difference method.

## Software Requirements

As homeworks will be submitted in the form of Jupyter notebooks, students will need to have Python and a package manager available on their computers. The best instructions for proper installation are found on the [Software Carpentry website](https://uwescience.github.io/2019-01-15-uw/) (scroll down to the **Setup** section). Please have this installed prior to the first day of class. We will cover the basics of Python, Markdown, and GitHub the first week of class to ensure you can properly submit homeworks.

## Conduct

The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable by students as they pursue their academic goals. In particular, please review the definitions of academic misconduct found [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH209.html#7) and [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH210.html#7). In the context of ChemE 512, it is expected that all work, homework and otherwise, is the students' own work. Students should also not use unauthorized materials during exams. Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication by the College of Engineering.

Students found to have engaged in academic misconduct may receive a zero on the assignment (or other possible outcome).

## Access and Accommodations

Your experience in this class is important to both me and the teaching team. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me as early as possible so we can discuss your needs in this course.

If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or health impacts) you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interaction process with you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with state and federal law.

## Religious Accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/) available on this site.
